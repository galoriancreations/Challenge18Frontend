Not every goal stands on its own, all connected and intended to be applied as a uniform set. For example, it is said that a strong, healthy and just society is measured according to its attitude toward the sick and the needy. Indeed, from education to all, if we encourage quality education for some of the population (goal number 4) Without worrying about eradicating poverty #SDG1, eradicating hunger #SDG2, and treating the sick #SDG3, we did not do anything to solve the challenge, and even exacerbated the general situation, increased gaps in knowledge, and increased socio-economic gaps."

How would you like your city to be like? Innovation plays a vital role in the success and development of every country and every community and municipal government around the world. According to the United Nations, more than 54% of the world’s population now resides in urban areas — a figure set to rise to 67% by 2050. And these urban centers are becoming increasingly important drivers of national and regional economic growth. A growing set of challenges they all face as they transform in the 21st century to improve peoples’ lives. How many people will live in Jerusalem by 2050? In Haifa? In Tel-Aviv?"
